    <p><h2>Description</h2></p>
    <p>Pumpkin pie has been a staple of my family since I was a little girl. In fact, I think it may be my favorite pie! I love shoving it in my mouth every Thanksgiving. Am I a turkey?? Because I'm <strong>STUFFED</strong>.</p>
    <p>I've recently gone gluten-free, dairy-free. While that's good for my health, it's <em>bad</em> for recipes. Did you know it's really hard to bake without gluten OR dairy?? Well, this is a delicious option that I've fallen in love with. Homemade and based off of my mother's recipe! But now it's mine :)</p>
    <p></p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <h4>Pie Crust</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>2 cups gluten-free bread flour (include xanthan gum)</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons light brown sugar</li>
        <li>1/2 cup dairy-free butter</li>
        <li>1 egg, <em>beaten</em></li>
        <li>ice water</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Pie</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>1/2 cup granulated sugar</li>
        <li>1/2 cup light brown sugar</li>
        <li>1/4 cup dairy-free butter, <em>softened</em></li>
        <li>1 tablespoon gluten-free bread flour</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon ground ginger</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon ground cinnamon</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon nutmeg</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
        <li>1/8 teaspoon ground cloves</li>
        <li>3 large eggs, <em>beaten</em></li>
        <li>2 cups (1 15oz can) pumpkin</li>
        <li>3/4 cups light coconut milk</li>
    </ul>
    <p></p>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <h4>Crust Instructions</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Whisk flour and sugar until fully combined.</li>
        <li>Cut the butter into the mixture with either the back of a fork or  a pastry cutter until sandy and crumbly.</li>
        <li>Add the beaten egg and mix well. Mixture will be crumbly, but yellow.</li>
        <li>Fold ice cold water tablespoon by tablespoon into the mixture until a dough holds together. <em>Better to have a wetter dough than a drier dough.</em></li>
        <li>Shape dough into a disc and roll out the dough between two pieces of parchment paper or on a slipmat until the dough is slightly larger than your pie tin.</li>
        <li>Flip the dough into your pie tin and shape it. If it cracks or breaks, you can mend it and shape it back into place.</li>
        <li><em>For this recipe</em>, par bake the crust for 12 minutes at 425F. It will bubble in the center, this hot air can be pressed out or you can use pie weights.
        </li>
    </ol>
    <h4>Pie Instructions</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>In a large mixing bowl, whisk together the sugars, flour, salt, and spices.</li>
        <li>In a separate bowl, beat together the eggs, vanilla, pumpkin, and coconut milk.</li>
        <li>Whisk into the dry ingredients. (For best flavor, cover and refrigerate the filling overnight before baking.)</li>
        <li>Using a deep-dish pie shell, crimp the edges above the rim; this will give you a little extra headroom to hold the filling when it expands in the oven.</li>
        <li>Preheat oven to 400˚F.</li>
        <li>When the oven is hot, place the pie pan on a baking sheet to catch any drips.</li>
        <li>Pour the filling into the par baked pie shell.</li>
        <li>Bake for 45-50 minutes, until the filling is set 2” in from the edge. (The center should still be wobbly.)</li>
        <li>Remove the pie from the oven and cool on a rack; the center will finish cooking through as the pie sits.</li>
    </ol>
